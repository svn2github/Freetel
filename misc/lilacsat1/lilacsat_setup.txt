# Install some other dependencies
git clone https://github.com/daniestevez/libfec.git
# follow the INSTALL file for that one.

# Compile/install gnuradio
sudo pybombs install gnuradio
# should compile and install stuff

# Install gqrx
sudo pybombs install gqrx 

# Hopefully by now we have everything needed to compile gr-satellites

git clone https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites.git
# use standard cmake build process with this one (mkdir build; cd build; cmake ../; etc...)
# once compiled/installed, run (from the gr-satellites root)
./compile_hierarchical.sh

# Now you have to make it all talk to each other :-)
# might need to ring me for that.

# GQRX
- Set up to talk to your SDR of choice.
- Up top, look for settings icon.
    - Make sure RX port set to 7356
- Up top, make sure little 'Remote control via TCP' icon is selected (2 computers icon)
- In receiver options tab (on the right) set Mode to USB
- Drag passband indication abover waterfall so filter width is maybe 30 kHz wide.
- Bottom right, click ... 
  - Network tab, set UDP port to 7355, hostname to localhost
- I'd also suggest setting the 'main' audio output to a dummy audio device, you don't want to hear the modem signal really.
- Click 'UDP' to have it start sending samples out via UDP port.

# Gpredict
- Set up as normal, update keps, set location, add lilacsat-1
- Edit -> Preferences -> Interfaces
  - Add new interface, radio type RX Only
  - Set port to 7356, hostname of localhost
- Back on gpredict main window, top right look for down arrow, go to Radio control
  - Choose LilacSat-1 in target dropdown
  - Set downlink freequency to 436.499.000 Hz
  - Choose gqrx from radio list, set cycle to 5000,
  - Click 'engage' then click 'track'
  - You should now see gqrx's frequency adjusting every 5 seconds.

# gr-satellite stuff
# When you get to this point, let me know >_>
